course project
Dang confusing on which program to write the file, where to save, and which program to push, then commit.  This result is from many attempts of
of just flat guessing and trying.  
Ended up writing and saving file in Rstudio, running Git GUI to push and commit, and did not use Github at all.  Is there any reason to have Github on my computer, or is it just a good place to go to on the web?
